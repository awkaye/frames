Through Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)  analysis,  we  examined  the  relationships  between  digital  well-being  variables  and  student performance. <br><br>3.3 Measures<br>The sleep qualityof the students was measuring using the Jenkins Sleep Scale (Juhola et al., 2021). The reliability of the scalewas found to be 0.80. One of the sample items was “I wake up feeling tired”. The Jenkins Sleep Scale is based on the LikertScale. It rangesfrom Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree. On the other hand, the Academic performance of the respondents was measured through the single item questionnaire. The item was “What is your Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)?”. The respondents entered their CGPAout of 4.0. The variable of Screen Time was measured through the single item questionnaire. The item was “What is your daily average screen time?”. The respondents entered their daily average screen time. The Social Media Use Scale (SMUS) (Wang et al., 2016) was used to measure the social media usage. The reliability of the scale was found to be 0.83.
